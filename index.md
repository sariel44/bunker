# Welcome

Welcome visitor :) You can take up contact with me if you want. You get reward for interesting information ;)
I also like to network btw, so don't hesitate to follow me on the twitter (or deviant art). Direct contact goes through wickr.

## Stuff I programmed

I did more, but not on this account ^_^

Simple document database on top of git and git-secret: https://github.com/sariel44/database
It also contains a simple task system. Got a pure CLI interface, I like that. 

Nice feature is that I can give others access to the information contained through their GPG key. 

Matrix like display program, just for fun and giggles. https://github.com/sariel44/matrix-gadget

## Foundations I like

If you want to do a good deed. 

https://www.zoekhonden.com/

They train and use dogs to find people that are lost. Not a fun job, but it is neccesary. Lots of veterans among their ranks.
