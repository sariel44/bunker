# Welcome

Welcome visitor :) You can take up contact with me if you want. You get reward for interesting information ;)
I also like to network btw, so don't hesitate to follow me on the twitter (or deviant art). Direct contact goes through wickr.

## Stuff I programmed

Simple document database on top of git and git-secret: https://github.com/sariel44/database
It also contains a simple task system. Got a pure CLI interface.

Nice feature is that I can give others access to the information contained through their GPG key. 

Matrix like display program, just for fun and giggles. https://github.com/sariel44/matrix-gadget
